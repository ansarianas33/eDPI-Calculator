Usage

The eDPI Calculator plugin provides a shortcode that can be used to display the calculator on any page or post.

To use the shortcode, simply add the following code to the page or post where you want the calculator to appear:

The shortcode will display a form where users can enter their mouse sensitivity and DPI settings. When the user clicks the "Calculate" button, the plugin will use AJAX to calculate the user's eDPI and display the result on the page.
